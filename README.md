# LinearLambdaCalculus

In this work, we create a Python implementation of the Linear Lambda Calculus
(LLC). While there has been work formalizing LLC, no such implementation exists
in Python. By doing so, we create a typed version of lambda calculus enforcing
linear logic in Python. By doing so, we build a compact yet effective model of
linear logic within Python that can be potentially used for future reasoning related
to linearity. This is similar to the purpose of STLC, which was built as a lightweight
model for traditional logic .
